# Python-Discord-Bot

This script is made for helping ROBLOX players get template IDs in the fastest, and most effecient way.
This bot automatically finds the IDs, and chats them to Discord via a webhook.



#Settings 

At the bottom of the main python script, you will see Username and Password. I would say to create a new account, then enter
those credentials into the system. Once you make the account, and enter the credentials, setup a Discord server. Discord
information can be found on the Discord website. Once your server is created, add a Webhook and copy the link. 
Near the bottom of the page, you will see "discord webhook," this is where you will paste your webhook link into.
Once finished, save the script and run it in your cmds, or terminal.
